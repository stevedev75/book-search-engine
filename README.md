# Book-Search-Engine

## My motivation for this project was to change the fully-functioning starter code that was built with a RESTful API and refactor it to use a GraphQL API to be used with Apollo Server.  

#### I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of the GraphQL API and Apollo Server, then deploying it via Heroku using MongoAtlas.  

#### This application solves the problem often of how to upgrade the code/technology of an already fully-working application in order to improve it with the latest standards.

#### In this project, I learned more about GraphQL API, Apollo Server and authentication.
